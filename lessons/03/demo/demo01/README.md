### Example:
To quickly test a simple Docker container, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This command runs the `hello-world` Docker image, which is a simple test image provided by Docker. It prints a friendly message confirming that Docker is properly installed and working on your system.

This command is useful for verifying that your Docker installation is set up correctly and can pull images from Docker Hub and run containers.
